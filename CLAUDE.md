This project is a example white label implementation of a bill splitting app.

We have setup 2 domains (`sidebadger.com` and `sidebadger.me`) and the app is hosted on `demo.sidebadger.com` (and `demo.sidebadge.me`).

The "real" app is firebase hosted by an external provider - we are just a open source demo whitelabel.
